# Predicting the Poverty Rate with ACS 5Yr Variables
MSDS 692 Final Project

Final presentation video: https://youtu.be/9nSMkF7D_mU

## Project Overview
Could we predict the poverty rate of different geographies in the United States by excluding income levels and instead utilizing other demographic variables?

This project explores the data from the U.S. Censusâ€™ American Community Survey (ACS-5yr) to find correlations between the poverty rate and other variables. We will explore data both at the state and county level, and find the best predictors and models. These could then be used to find the poverty rate in counties where the U.S. Census does not collect poverty data each year.
